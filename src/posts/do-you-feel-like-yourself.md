title: Do you feel like yourself?
---
My hair stylist casually asked this question as she finished applying product. I mumbled an affirmative, though deep down that wasn’t quite the case. In a string of not so great haircuts, this was just the next one. It is a smart question, though, as that’s the goal of any haircut.

I took the question with me out of the salon and gave it a deeper meaning, as I am wont to do. Do I feel like myself? I don’t think that I have for a while, but I think that this has more to do with what I’ve done to my self. I feel as though I’ve been in transition for quite a while now. I’m in the process of turning into someone much different from what I was before. I’m not sure what self I am just yet.

Growing up, I was deeply uncomfortable in my skin, unsure of how to carry myself or be a person. This is all part of growing up, but it wasn’t until college that I began to come into my own. After college, I began to lose it again. I think, sometimes, a great deal of who we are is just simply the people who are around us. To feel like myself is to have someone show me. To feel like myself is to be seen for who I am and warmly embraced for it.

As much as we talk about loving ourselves starting with our selves, I think that our social nature proves otherwise. Left to my own devices, I will critique and tear down every aspect of myself. I am my own worst enemy. To feel like myself is not to be left alone in a closet. I need love to be alive. I need someone to make me feel. Without them, I am not myself.
