As we continue to figure out how a world with social media affects our lives, I think that it’s worth reflecting on a broader topic of the story vs. the experience.

If someone tells you that they just went to see a play, and that it made them feel warm and fuzzy and they couldn’t recommend it enough, that’s a story. It’s their experience that they have summed up in a few words, likely neglecting to share with you the more mundane or unsatisfactory parts.

Social media is just that. A story, told by someone who wants you to see the best version. The play changed my life. Consuming these stories, which look very much like reality, are affecting our day-to-day experience in ways never before experienced.

I can drop in on someone’s story from halfway around the world, see what they’ve eaten, where they’ve been, what kind of clothes they wear, all without visiting or having ever visited their home country. Of course, I can’t do this with everyone, and it’s limited to those who share (or overshare this information) with the world. But, that’s enough to evoke a comparison to this foreign story.

High school as a concept is remembered favorably by some people, filled with nostalgia and thoughts of better times. For others, it was largely something to escape, and it fills them with relief thinking about how it’s over. Your specific experience can come into conflict with another as told through media.

Outside of, or next to, this conflict, you’re able to enjoy a story told about an experience that might look very similar to yours, but you participate in it in a way that it is wholly new.

So what am I getting at? It’s that social media needs to be treated purely as an entertainment medium, and you must swear off any and all comparisons you make. This must be done consciously, as your unconscious will gladly take care of making you feel bad all on its own.
